# Nutrition Label
The purpose of this repo is to monitor my progress in learning HTML by making a Nutrition Label. I am utilizing the freeCodeCamp [Learn Typography by Building a Nutrition Label](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/#learn-typography-by-building-a-nutrition-label) for this repo.
